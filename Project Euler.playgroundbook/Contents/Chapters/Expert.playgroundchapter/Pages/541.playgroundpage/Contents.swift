 # Divisibility of Harmonic Number Denominators
 [Problem 541](https://projecteuler.net/problem=541) - Diifculty level: 85%

 The nth harmonic number H*n* is defined as the sum of the multiplicative inverses of the first *n* positive integers, and can be written as a reduced fraction a*n* / b*n*.

 Let M(p) be the largest value of *n* such that bn is not divisible by p.

 For example, M(3) = 68 because

 is not divisible by 3, but all larger harmonic numbers have denominators divisible by 3.
 
 You are given M(7) = 719102.
 
 Find M(137).
