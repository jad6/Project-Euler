This book contains the problems from the excellent website Project Euler and brings them to Swift Playground Books.
 
Each problem has its own page that you can solve using Swift. These pages are found in the four chapters of the book:
 
 1. Beginner - Difficulty levels less than 25%
 2. Intermediate - Difficulty levels between 26% and 50%
 3. Hard - Difficulty levels between 51% and 75%
 4. Expert - Difficulty levels above 76% 
 
This book is simply a way to relay the awesome problems that the website has available and to make it accessible to a wider audience. You can then enter the result of the problem into the website to confirm the solution and join the community of problem solvers.
