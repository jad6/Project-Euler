 # Quadratic primes
 [Problem 27](https://projecteuler.net/problem=27) - Diifculty level: 5%

 Euler discovered the remarkable quadratic formula:

 n^2 + n + 41

 It turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive integer values 0 ≤ n ≤ 39. However, when n = 40, 40^2 + 40 + 41 = 40(40+1) + 41 is divisible by 41, and certainly when n=41, 41^2 + 41 + 41 is clearly divisible by 41.

 The incredible formula n^2 − 79n + 1601 was discovered, which produces 80 primes for the consecutive values 0 ≤ n ≤ 79. The product of the coefficients, −79 and 1601, is −126479.

 Considering quadratics of the form:

 n^2 + an + b, where |a| < 1000 and |b| ≤ 1000 
 
 where |n| is the modulus/absolute value of n

 ```
 e.g. |11| = 11 and |−4| = 4
 ```

 Find the product of the coefficients, a and b, for the quadratic expression that produces the maximum number of primes for consecutive values of n, starting with n = 0
