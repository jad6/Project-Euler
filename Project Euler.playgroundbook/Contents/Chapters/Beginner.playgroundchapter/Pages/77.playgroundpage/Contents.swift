 [Problem 77](https://projecteuler.net/problem=77) - Diifculty level: 25%

 It is possible to write ten as the sum of primes in exactly five different ways:

 7 + 3
 5 + 5
 5 + 3 + 2
 3 + 3 + 2 + 2
 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2

 What is the first value which can be written as the sum of primes in over five thousand different ways?
