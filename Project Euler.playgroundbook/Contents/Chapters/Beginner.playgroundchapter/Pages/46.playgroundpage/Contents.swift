 # Goldbach's other conjecture
 [Problem 46](https://projecteuler.net/problem=46) - Diifculty level: 5%

 It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number can be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square.

 ```
 9 = 7 + 2×1^2
 15 = 7 + 2×2^2
 21 = 3 + 2×3^2
 25 = 7 + 2×3^2
 27 = 19 + 2×2^2
 33 = 31 + 2×1^2
 ```

 It turns out that the conjecture was false.

 What is the smallest odd composite that cannot be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square?
