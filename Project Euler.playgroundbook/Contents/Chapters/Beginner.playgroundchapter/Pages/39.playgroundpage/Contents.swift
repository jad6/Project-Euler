 [Problem 39](https://projecteuler.net/problem=39) - Difficulty level: 5%

 If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides, {a,b,c}, there are exactly three solutions for p = 120.

 {20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}

 For which value of p â‰¤ 1000, is the number of solutions maximised?
