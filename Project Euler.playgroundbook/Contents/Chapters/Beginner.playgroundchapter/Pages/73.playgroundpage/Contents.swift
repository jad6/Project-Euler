 # Counting fractions in a range
 [Problem 73](https://projecteuler.net/problem=73) - Difficulty level: 15%
 Consider the fraction, n/d, where n and d are positive integers. If n<d and HCF(n,d)=1, it is called a reduced proper fraction.

 If we list the set of reduced proper fractions for d ≤ 8 in ascending order of size, we get:

 1/8, 1/7, 1/6, 1/5, 1/4, 2/7, 1/3, **3/8, 2/5, 3/7**, 1/2, 4/7, 3/5, 5/8, 2/3, 5/7, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 6/7, 7/8

 It can be seen that there are 3 fractions between 1/3 and 1/2.

 How many fractions lie between 1/3 and 1/2 in the sorted set of reduced proper fractions for d ≤ 12,000?
