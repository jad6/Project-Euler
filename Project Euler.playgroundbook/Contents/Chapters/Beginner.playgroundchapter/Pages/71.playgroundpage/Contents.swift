 [Problem 71](https://projecteuler.net/problem=71) - Difficulty level: 10%

 Consider the fraction, n/d, where n and d are positive integers. If n<d and HCF(n,d)=1, it is called a reduced proper fraction.

 If we list the set of reduced proper fractions for d ≤ 8 in ascending order of size, we get:

 1/8, 1/7, 1/6, 1/5, 1/4, 2/7, 1/3, 3/8, **2/5**, 3/7, 1/2, 4/7, 3/5, 5/8, 2/3, 5/7, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 6/7, 7/8

 It can be seen that 2/5 is the fraction immediately to the left of 3/7.

 By listing the set of reduced proper fractions for d ≤ 1,000,000 in ascending order of size, find the numerator of the fraction immediately to the left of 3/7.
