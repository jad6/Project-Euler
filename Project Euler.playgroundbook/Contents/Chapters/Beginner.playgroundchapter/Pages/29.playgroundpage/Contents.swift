 [Problem 18](https://projecteuler.net/problem=18) - Diifculty level: 5%

 By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent numbers on the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is 23.

 That is, 3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23.

 Find the maximum total from top to bottom of the triangle below:

 *NOTE: As there are only 16384 routes, it is possible to solve this problem by trying every route. However, Problem 67, is the same challenge with a triangle containing one-hundred rows; it cannot be solved by brute force, and requires a clever method! ;o)*
