 [Problem 25](https://projecteuler.net/problem=25) - Difficulty level: 5%

 The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:

 F(n) = F(n−1) + F(n−2), where F(1) = 1 and F(2) = 1.
 Hence the first 12 terms will be:

 ```
 F(1) = 1
 F(2) = 1
 F(3) = 2
 F(4) = 3
 F(5) = 5
 F(6) = 8
 F(7) = 13
 F(8) = 21
 F(9) = 34
 F(10) = 55
 F(11) = 89
 F(12) = 144
 ```

 The 12th term, F(12), is the first term to contain three digits.

 What is the index of the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain 1000 digits
