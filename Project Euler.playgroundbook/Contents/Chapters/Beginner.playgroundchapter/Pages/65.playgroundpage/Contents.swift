 The square root of 2 can be written as an infinite continued fraction.

 The infinite continued fraction can be written, √2 = [1;(2)], (2) indicates that 2 repeats ad infinitum. In a similar way, √23 = [4;(1,3,1,8)].

 It turns out that the sequence of partial values of continued fractions for square roots provide the best rational approximations. Let us consider the convergents for √2.

 Hence the sequence of the first ten convergents for √2 are:

 1, 3/2, 7/5, 17/12, 41/29, 99/70, 239/169, 577/408, 1393/985, 3363/2378, ...

 What is most surprising is that the important mathematical constant,
 
 e = [2; 1,2,1, 1,4,1, 1,6,1 , ... , 1,2k,1, ...].

 The first ten terms in the sequence of convergents for e are:

 2, 3, 8/3, 11/4, 19/7, 87/32, 106/39, 193/71, 1264/465, 1457/536, ...

 The sum of digits in the numerator of the 10th convergent is 1+4+5+7=17.

 Find the sum of digits in the numerator of the 100th convergent of the continued fraction for e.
