 # Diophantine equation
 [Problem 66](https://projecteuler.net/problem=66) - Diifculty level: 25%

 Consider quadratic Diophantine equations of the form:

 x^2 – Dy^2 = 1

 For example, when D=13, the minimal solution in x is 649^2 – 13×180^2 = 1.

 It can be assumed that there are no solutions in positive integers when D is square.

 By finding minimal solutions in x for D = {2, 3, 5, 6, 7}, we obtain the following:

 Hence, by considering minimal solutions in x for D ≤ 7, the largest x is obtained when D=5.

 Find the value of D ≤ 1000 in minimal solutions of x for which the largest value of x is obtained.
