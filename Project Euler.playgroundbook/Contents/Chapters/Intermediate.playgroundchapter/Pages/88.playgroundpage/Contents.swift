 # Product-sum numbers
 [Problem 88](https://projecteuler.net/problem=88) - Difficulty level: 40%

 A natural number, N, that can be written as the sum and product of a given set of at least two natural numbers, {ɑ₁, a₂, ... , ak} is called a product-sum number: N = a₁ + a₂ + ... + ak = a₁ × a₂ × ... × ak.

 For example, 6 = 1 + 2 + 3 = 1 × 2 × 3.

 For a given set of size, k, we shall call the smallest N with this property a minimal product-sum number. The minimal product-sum numbers for sets of size, k = 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are as follows.

     k=2: 4 = 2 × 2 = 2 + 2
     k=3: 6 = 1 × 2 × 3 = 1 + 2 + 3
     k=4: 8 = 1 × 1 × 2 × 4 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 4
     k=5: 8 = 1 × 1 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2
     k=6: 12 = 1 × 1 × 1 × 1 × 2 × 6 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 6

 Hence for 2≤k≤6, the sum of all the minimal product-sum numbers is 4+6+8+12 = 30; note that 8 is only counted once in the sum.

 In fact, as the complete set of minimal product-sum numbers for 2≤k≤12 is {4, 6, 8, 12, 15, 16}, the sum is 61.

 What is the sum of all the minimal product-sum numbers for 2≤k≤12000?
